--docker compose
It lets us run multiple containers and link them in a network.

Once the containers of the images are defined in docker compose, they automatically become part of the network.
We donÂ´t have to manually define them.
Note: "pgdatabase" will be the hostname/address when connecting to the pgadmin server. "5432" is the port



services:
  pgdatabase:
    image: postgres:13
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=root
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=root
      - POSTGRES_DB=ny_taxi
    volumes:
      - "./ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data:rw"
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
  pgadmin:
    image: dpage/pgadmin4
    environment:
      - PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL=admin@admin.com
      - PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=root
    ports:
      - "8080:80"


Note:
Once created we will have a container (2_docker_sql) that runs 2 images. 
The single containers of postgres and pgadmin will still be there.

Starting:
docker compose up

Closing:
docker compose down
